# Digit_Recognition_using_CNN
Digit recognition- It refers to the process of identifying and classifying printed digits from a dataset.
It used to wide range of applications, such as check processing, document analysis, postal automation, and number plate recognition.
Before Deep learning the process is of digit recognition typically involves several steps. First, the input image is preprocessed 
to remove noise, normalize the size and orientation, and enhance the contrast. Then, features are extracted from the image, such as
pixel values, edges, corners, or histograms.deep learning techniques, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have achieved 
state-of-the-art performance in digit recognition, surpassing the humanaccuracy level. These models can learn complex representations
of the input images by stacking multiple layers of convolutional,pooling, and fully connected layers, and using backpropagation to 
adjust the weights and biases.Moreover, CNNs can handle variations in the digit shapes, sizes, and styles, as well as the presence 
of noise, distortions, or occlusions.
